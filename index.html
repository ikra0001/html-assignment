        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a student in <em>Algonquin College</em>, I enjoy 3D printing in different formats but prefer <abbr title="proprietary liquid crystal mask technology">MSLA</abbr> 
            printing. I like the creative digital arts, be it motion graphics, graphic design or animation I dabble in everything. I finished a year and a half of Graphic Design, 
            but it felt too focused compared to what I wanted. The <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program so far covers more subjects with a little more detail, and I'm glad I 
            transfered into this program.

           I lived in Canada for 9 years now, moved around a lot changing different colleges and cities, but now that I'm in ottawa it is a nice to finally settle down and not worry 
           about the next move. I have been managing a few properties my parents own and have been working on renovating them, to work our way up for higher value real estate. Been a
           hard time continuing my studies in between, but I do my best.
